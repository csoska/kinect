# kinect
Render 3D video and display in virtual reality using kinect input data

There are 3 parts to this project:
1. Generate the square "pixels" to display the combined depth/color data
2. A shader to combine the data from the kinect
3. A-frame VR as a way to combine the mesh object created from step one and map the video data using the shader

The python program generates the mesh 

The shader is kinect_shader.js 

The A-frame scene was created for Reality Computing at Carnegie Mellon University, part of the IDeATe program and all code is free to use, modify, and distribute as per the license.
